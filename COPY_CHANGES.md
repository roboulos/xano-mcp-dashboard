## SECTION 1: HERO (src/components/sections/hero.tsx)

### Hero Headline
**CURRENT (line 106):**
```
The Framework for AI-Powered Xano Development
```
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
AI That Actually Ships Xano Endpoints
```
**WHY:** Direct, outcome-focused. Addresses the core problem that AI usually fails to deploy working code.

### Hero Subtitle
**CURRENT (lines 123-124):**
```
Stop debugging broken AI code. Build in 2 minutes what used to take 4 hours. 
Ship with confidence using a framework you can finally trust.
```
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
"80-90% of the time, I click Run and it just works." Build endpoints with proper filters, 
not green expression syntax. TypeScript SDK + middleware = AI that actually understands Xano.
```
**WHY:** Uses Robert's actual quote, explains the technical differentiator clearly.

### Trust Indicators
**CURRENT (line 131):**
```
100+ MCP tools ready to use
```
**KEEP AS IS** - This is accurate from transcripts

**CURRENT (line 135):**
```
82% deployment success rate
```
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
80-90% first-try success
```
**WHY:** Uses Robert's actual quote from transcripts

**CURRENT (line 139):**
```
Live weekly debugging calls
```
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Weekly MCP Wednesday calls
```
**WHY:** Accurate day from transcripts

### Urgency Line
**CURRENT (line 166):**
```
Join 47+ developers who ship 10x faster with AI they can trust.
```
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Join developers like Luke who "prefer the AI version to one of my developers."
```
**WHY:** Uses real testimonial instead of unverified count

## SECTION 2: FEATURES (src/components/sections/features.tsx)

### Section Badge & Headline
**CURRENT:**
```
Badge: "Real Results, Not Theory"
H2: "The Shortcut to AI Development That Actually Works"
```
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Badge: "TypeScript SDK + Middleware"
H2: "Why This AI Doesn't Break Like The Others"
```
**WHY:** Highlights the technical differentiator

### Tab Labels
**CURRENT:**
```
"üî• What You'll Build"
"üéì How You'll Learn"
"üí∞ Your Investment"
```
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
"‚ùå Why AI Fails in Xano"
"‚úÖ How We Fixed It"
"üìà Real Developer Stories"
```
**WHY:** Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Proof structure

### Problem Tab Content
**ADD NEW CONTENT:**
```
### The Problem With AI + Xano

**No Feedback Loop**: XanoScript gives zero error details. AI just sees "failed."

**No Guardrails**: AI generates invalid syntax, green expressions everywhere, doesn't use filters.

**No Context**: AI doesn't know Xano's 200+ filters or when to use them.

Result: You spend hours debugging, or give up entirely.
```

### Solution Tab Content
**ADD NEW CONTENT:**
```
### The Solution: SDK + Middleware

**TypeScript SDK**: Enforces valid XanoScript, auto-converts to filter syntax, provides linting.

**Middleware Layer**: Catches errors, provides feedback, retries with corrections.

**100+ MCP Tools**: Every Xano API endpoint mapped and optimized.

Robert: "I created an SDK that takes all of that and adds guardrails... 80-90% of the time, I click Run and it just works."
```

### Stories Tab Content
**REPLACE WITH REAL STORIES:**
```
### Luke (UK) - From Skeptic to Evangelist
"I was in Greece last week by the pool... got everything working on my phone."
"I actually now prefer the AI version to one of my developers."
Built complete client platform while on vacation.

### Shane (UK) - 4 Hours ‚Üí 2 Minutes
"It created this function which probably would have taken me about four hours in two minutes."
Created 1,500-line "Snappy cookbook" to train the AI on patterns.

### Nick (Australia) - Trust Through Proof
"This seemed too good to be true... I booked a call before entering my API key."
Now building automation systems, "We're at the front of something big."

### West & John (Healthcare) - Enterprise Adoption
Started with read-only credentials for security.
Now using for production healthcare systems.
```

---

## SECTION 3: FAQ (src/components/sections/faq.tsx)

### Question: "How secure is my data?"
**CURRENT ANSWER:** Generic security promises
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Start with read-only credentials if you want (like West's healthcare team did). 
OAuth 2.0 when you're ready. Work in a branch to test safely. 
We never store your Xano data - everything runs through your own API keys.
Nick from Australia even booked a call first because it "seemed too good to be true."
```

### Question: "What makes this different from other AI tools?"
**ADD NEW ANSWER:**
```
TypeScript SDK with guardrails + middleware feedback loop. 
While other tools generate broken XanoScript with green expressions everywhere, 
ours uses Xano filters properly, leverages all 200+ operations, and gives the AI 
actual error feedback to fix issues. Result: "80-90% first-try success" (Robert).
```

### Question: "Who's actually using this?"
**ADD NEW ANSWER:**
```
Luke builds client platforms (even from a pool in Greece on his phone).
Shane cut 4-hour tasks to 2 minutes. Nick runs automation in Australia.
West & John use it for healthcare systems. Developers who tried building 
their own MCP tools switched to this. Even Ray Deck uses and recommends it.
```

### Question: "What are MCP Wednesday calls?"
**ADD NEW ANSWER:**
```
Weekly live sessions where Robert builds endpoints, answers questions, and shows
new techniques. Luke, Shane, West, Ray and others regularly attend. You'll see
real builds, real problems solved, real results. Not marketing - actual development.
```

## SECTION 4: TESTIMONIALS (src/components/sections/testimonials.tsx)

**REPLACE ALL GENERIC TESTIMONIALS WITH:**

```javascript
const testimonials = [
  {
    quote: "I was in Greece last week by the pool... got everything working on my phone. I actually now prefer the AI version to one of my developers.",
    author: "Luke",
    role: "Platform Builder",
    company: "UK",

## SECTION 5: PRICING (src/components/sections/pricing.tsx)

### Section Headline
**CURRENT:** "Investment That Pays For Itself"
**REPLACE WITH:** "Less Than One Hour of Debugging"

### Section Subtitle
**CURRENT:** Generic ROI claims
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Robert's consulting rate: $300/hour. This tool: Less than that per month.
Join MCP Wednesday calls, ship endpoints that work, stop debugging XanoScript.
```

### Pricing Tiers (if shown)
**ADD CONTEXT:**
- **Starter ($99)**: "Perfect for Luke's 'pool-side building' workflow"
- **Pro ($499)**: "What Shane uses for '4 hours ‚Üí 2 minutes' builds"
- **Enterprise ($2k+)**: "West's healthcare-grade setup with priority support"

## SECTION 6: CTA (src/components/sections/cta.tsx)

### Main CTA Headline
**CURRENT:** "Ready to Ship Faster?"
**REPLACE WITH:** "Stop Debugging. Start Shipping."

### CTA Description
**CURRENT:** Generic productivity claims
**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Join MCP Wednesday. See Robert build live. Watch the SDK + middleware 
turn "it failed" into "it works." Then build your own - with guardrails.
```

### Button Text
**CURRENT:** "Start Building Today"
**REPLACE WITH:** "Get Access + Join Wednesday Call"

---

## SECTION 7: PROBLEM SECTION (New - Add if not exists)

### Why AI Fails With Xano

**The Reality Check:**
```
"I don't believe you" - Luke's first reaction
"This seemed too good to be true" - Nick before booking a demo
"We tried building internally... ran into a lot of issues" - West's team
```

**The Technical Problems:**
1. **No Feedback**: XanoScript returns "failed" with no details
2. **No Guardrails**: AI generates invalid syntax, green expressions
3. **No Filter Knowledge**: 200+ Xano filters, AI uses none properly
4. **No Context**: Can't distinguish table operations from API operations

**The Human Cost:**
- 4 hours debugging what should take 2 minutes (Shane's experience)
- Developers refusing to adopt AI tools (Luke's team resistance)
- $300/hour consultants called in to fix AI mistakes (Robert's rate)

---

## SECTION 8: SOLUTION SECTION (New - Add if not exists)

### How We Fixed It

**TypeScript SDK (The Guardrails):**
```
"I created an SDK that basically takes all of that and adds guardrails... 
like the lanes of a bowling alley" - Robert
```
- Enforces valid XanoScript syntax
- Auto-converts math to filter pipelines
- Prevents green expression soup
- Types every operation

**Middleware Layer (The Feedback):**
```
"The middleware provides linting... it tells the AI exactly what went wrong
and how to fix it" - Robert
```
- Catches errors before deployment
- Returns actionable feedback to AI
- Auto-retries with corrections
- Tests endpoints automatically

**100+ MCP Tools (The Coverage):**
```
"Over 100 tools that map to the Xano metadata API... 
and they're all optimized for AI use" - Robert
```

**The Result:**
```
"80-90% of the time, I click Run and it just works" - Robert
"I prefer the AI version to one of my developers" - Luke
"4 hours ‚Üí 2 minutes" - Shane
```

## COPY STYLE GUIDE

### DO Use:
- Direct quotes from transcripts
- Specific metrics (80-90%, 100+ tools, 4 hours ‚Üí 2 minutes)
- Real names and locations (Luke/UK, Shane/UK, Nick/Australia)
- Technical accuracy (TypeScript SDK, middleware, XanoScript)
- Problem-first messaging (why AI fails, then how we fix it)

### DON'T Use:
- Made-up metrics (82%, 47+ developers)
- Generic claims ("10x faster", "revolutionary")
- Vague benefits ("transform your workflow")
- Corporate speak ("enterprise-grade", "best-in-class")
- Unverifiable urgency ("12 spots left")

### Voice & Tone:
- Developer-to-developer honesty
- Technical but accessible
- Skepticism-acknowledging ("seemed too good to be true")
- Results-focused ("it just works")
- Community-oriented (MCP Wednesday, weekly calls)

## TRACKING SUCCESS

Monitor these trust signals:
1. Decrease in "is this real?" inquiries
2. Increase in technical questions vs. skepticism
3. More developers starting with read-only credentials (trust ladder)
4. MCP Wednesday attendance growth
5. Word-of-mouth mentions (like Shane finding Luke's video)
