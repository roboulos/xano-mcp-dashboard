# Xano Backend Agent Changes Summary

## What the Agent Did in Xano

The xano-backend-debugger agent made the following changes:

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Dashboard Metrics Endpoints
The agent appears to have fixed the calculation errors in the Dashboard Analytics API group (api:ZVMx4ul_):
- `mcp-metrics/summary` - Now properly handles null values and calculations
- `mcp-metrics/trends` - Fixed trend calculations
- `mcp-metrics/performance` - Fixed performance metrics
- `mcp-metrics/errors` - Fixed error analytics
- `mcp-metrics/export` - Fixed export functionality
- `mcp-metrics/tool/{tool_name}` - Fixed tool-specific metrics
- `mcp-logs/cleanup` - Fixed log cleanup

### 2. ‚úÖ Created/Updated Billing Endpoints
The agent created comprehensive billing endpoints in the Stripe & Billing Management API group (api:Ogyn777x):
- `billing/plans` - Lists subscription plans
- `billing/subscribe` - Creates Stripe checkout sessions
- `billing/subscription` - Gets current subscription (THIS is what our frontend needs!)
- `billing/cancel` - Cancels subscriptions
- `billing/reactivate` - Reactivates cancelled subscriptions
- `billing/upgrade` - Upgrades/downgrades plans
- `billing/invoices` - Lists payment history
- `billing/payment-methods` - GET/POST/DELETE payment methods
- `billing/usage` - Usage statistics
- `billing/quota-status` - Quota warnings
- `stripe/webhook` - Stripe webhook handler

## üö® The Problem: Frontend Routes Don't Match

Our Next.js API routes are still pointing to the OLD endpoints. We need to update them to match the new Xano endpoints.

### Dashboard Metrics Routes
All working in Xano, but frontend expects different URLs:
- Frontend calls: `/mcp-metrics/summary`
- Xano has: `/mcp-metrics/summary` ‚úÖ (This should work!)

### Billing Routes
Frontend expects different endpoints than what Xano provides:
- Frontend calls: `/billing/subscription`
- Xano has: `/billing/subscription` ‚úÖ (This should work too!)

## üîç Why It's Still Failing

Looking at the API responses:
1. Dashboard metrics returns: `{"error": "Failed to fetch summary metrics"}`
2. Billing subscription returns: `{"error": "Invalid token."}`

This suggests:
1. The metrics endpoint might still have an error OR the auth token isn't being passed correctly
2. The billing endpoint is rejecting our auth token

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Update auth token handling** - The token might be expired or malformed
2. **Test Xano endpoints directly** - Use the MCP tools to test if they actually work
3. **Update API route base URLs** if needed
4. **Check error logs** in Xano to see what's failing
