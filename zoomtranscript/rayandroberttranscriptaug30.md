Recording in progress. Hello, Robert, how do you do today?
Robert Boulos | 00:03
Good, how are you doing, Ray?
rhdeck@gmail.com | 00:05
Right, I have to say, the nature of the clothing makes you think it's a little bit of a cooler day in Toronto today, so that's the real... Sorry, Blair.
Robert Boulos | 00:06
I can't see you. It is... Sorry, I can't see you. I'm not sure if it's just me, it's like... I'm not used to just hearing this. It's strange.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 00:19
Blair.
There we go. That used to... Just me. A little gibberish. There. Yeah.
Robert Boulos | 00:32
Very nice to see you.
Nice to see you on a Saturday again. The weather in Toronto... The plan, actually, originally was this weekend. My fiancée wanted to go camping in Algonquin. To be honest, I had to... I had to tap out, like I said, I have work I have to do.
Because there's no power up, there is no electricity. I don't even know if there's a signal. So it was one of those... That was actually one of the things that I asked for help with. Actually asked her for help with. Just let's just not do that this weekend.
Just to say to what you mentioned about the weather, one of the reasons is because I know if we go to Algonquin, how cold it's going to be. Sleeping in a tent. Yeah, maybe just a reflection of where my mind is right now, which is it feels like I'm in this critical stage where, to go and disappear for three days... I feel like in between, all the way leading up to today, but especially the next three days. I feel like I have an opportunity to keep pushing and just make it to whatever that next island is where, naturally, everything seems to be pushing towards.
Yeah, no. So that's, I think, the big story of the last few days. The theme, I would say, of the last few days. Then there's... I feel like it's maybe worth matching or maybe not, but I've just felt like this, it's just weird.
It's hard. It's not anyone's problem or anything, but it's just... How can I describe it? Everybody wants me to be a certain way. I'm a pretty nice person. I'm just saying that it sounds stupid, but there was a ball that dropped on my fiancée's windshield of our car.
Somebody dropped a soccer ball or something. We didn't see it happen. This was a few weeks ago. We found a note on the car and it said, "Hey, you can call us." Okay,
so I called the person, and then they were going... I mean, they're the ones who left their number and they offered to pay towards it, but long story short, basically, I'm not sure how he went cold and he stopped answering.
Then, I'd made the mistake of telling my family a bit about the story, and so everyone's opinion again, everybody has a different way of handling things.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 03:41
Hey.
Robert Boulos | 03:43
I'm just being pressured very much to handle it the way that the rest of my family would handle it. Which to them would be... Threaten him with the police, basically, go straight to... I have never threatened somebody with the police. I don't do it. I just don't feel comfortable with it. Anyways, my point is just that, I just appreciate our discussions, to be honest, because I just feel like... I don't know, it just feels like it's... I'm not sure even... I'm not sure if you would call the... I'm not sure if you would say... I'm not.
I just don't know. I mean, we all need examples to look towards. I don't have a lot of examples. When I look around me and I just see everyone telling me to call the police, this might be the only conversation where this is a reminder of maybe there's whatever it is that I'm trying to just double down on, which is everything about me.
That's not to do with that. That's because I don't. So I just appreciate it. I just appreciate your perspective because sometimes it feels like... I feel like sometimes it's saving me from becoming this person that everybody else seems to have already become in my family, at least, which is to be very conflict-seeking, I guess.
I don't know, I'm not sure. I don't know what the right thing or wrong thing to do is sometimes. But all I'm saying is that you've made me feel more confident in some and just in taking the high road, I suppose.
Just focusing on the things that I feel okay with. Well, I get $250 Canadian as an American. So to me again, could you get more out of life or no more out of life? Could you get more out of people if you were to take that technique? Yes, you probably could.
But I think you'd lose something. I think you'd be the type of person who's going to end up doing that all the time. I think like... And that's the way I grew up seeing my dad, he was always taking that hard line with people.
It created, I think, a very opposite effect, maybe to the other side of the pendulum where I am a bit too nice and I let people sometimes get away with things that I shouldn't, but all I've seen is the other extreme more than anything, so I'm trying to reach a balance. I appreciate this conversation because, yeah, more than in more ways than just the business side, I feel like it's evolving me as a person.
So, I just want to share that because I'm going through... Figuring out.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 06:33
Yes. It's tricky. Other people have their idea of what you should do, particularly when it starts being tied up with issues of masculinity, right? Men would do this kind of thing, but there's more to the world than conflict.
Robert Boulos | 06:41
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 06:50
Even as that brand of masculinity is getting a bit of a renaissance right now, certainly in American society, even with the present being in the manosphere, that aspect which we actually associate with far-right politics. There's pretty good research, which I have read because I like to depress myself, I guess. Just about the run-up to World War II and the rise of the Nazi party.
Robert Boulos | 07:03
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 07:17
Party which was heavily about Germany feeling emasculated.
That tricked me down into society as well. So, the joke I make is that half the society seems to talk about toxic masculinity, and the other half seems to be proving it. It seems to be doing everything they can to prove the first half, right?
Robert Boulos | 07:38
Yeah. Exactly.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 07:40
Yeah, and there's a better way, and I think that I do look to you as someone who is thoughtful about that and the.
Robert Boulos | 07:50
Thank you.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 07:53
And, it does not need to be about conflict. It can be about creation.
Robert Boulos | 07:58
Yeah, exactly. And it's tough. I mean, I appreciate it, even though that a person like you even exists. If I live, if I... It seems more like... I don't know. It's hard to find people who honestly think the way you think. Almost to a point where you think it's like a mythical...
If it wasn't for having conversations with you, you might eventually become convinced that it's just not real. It's like you're just a pin in the sky type of idea, but, yeah, you know.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 08:34
Yeah. There's a question of, like, do you think you need to... How do you make more money? Do you make more money by cutting the pie or do you make more money by growing it?
Robert Boulos | 08:43
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 08:45
And, I think it was Novella Ravicants. I mean, the Naval Ravicants, which is a collection of his writings assembled by someone else, but one of the ideas in it is that he doesn't return things. I thought that was a really good idea when you talk about the $250, right?
He doesn't do returns. He doesn't do returns because it's not worth his if you... It's the wrong thing. He gives it away because he's made a decision that the return is not worth his time. right?
Robert Boulos | 09:09
Interesting, just.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 09:09
So if you like, it's the wrong thing. He gives it away and the because he's made a decision that, like, the return is not worth its time.
And I think about that because my wife actually spends a lot of time managing and then executing on returns.
Robert Boulos | 09:24
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 09:25
Mike, I generally don't buy something unless I want it, and then if we... If I buy it and turns out to be the wrong thing, I really don't want to go through the hassle.
It's not.
Robert Boulos | 09:32
Yeah, yes, exactly.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 09:33
It's not my time. You know, like the... A good use of my psychology, right? I don't want to be dealing with the stress of it or what have you.
Robert Boulos | 09:45
I totally agree. That's actually very true about me, too. If I buy something, it would take quite a bit for me to feel like I want to return it.
Usually, it's really... I can't even think about the last thing I've returned, actually. But then again, it could be painted in a way that... What, you don't care about your money? You're wasteful.
It's like, no. I don't know how to explain it to somebody who doesn't necessarily understand. But I look at my energy during the day as not infinite, it's finite. If I'm going to choose every single day what I'm going to do, I think that it's costing me more to sit down and try to plan that than to just do
it. If I have an assistant, then sure, maybe that's fine. Go and do those things and hope that maybe the system would be doing something else rather than just managing my returns. But then again, there comes into... What's your time worth?
What's your time worth more than this? It's not worth... I just actually... That's actually something that's nice to hear as well, at least not just me.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 10:57
Right? I mean, your time is certainly finite and your positive NG is bounded by the bound time you have, right?
Robert Boulos | 11:02
Yes, nice.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 11:03
So what I would like to do is have all my time spent doing the things that I feel positively about.
I can quite get that. But, man, I get that number pretty damn high, and I'm pretty happy about that.
Robert Boulos | 11:14
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 11:16
And I'm just when I'm spending time on things that I don't want to be spending time on, then that's not so good. Not so great.
You know, I look for not like... Okay, man, how do you get anything done? How do you work a list? This is, I guess, the systems thing, right? They were talking about with Ellie, and I used some fairly broad things like study, sell, ship, right? Am I getting joy out of this?
If I'm not getting joy out of this, I can be switching because I can be studying, selling, or shipping, right? I'm way over-indexing on one of them. Okay? How can I do one of the others? Which part of it? Can I find joy in?
Robert Boulos | 11:53
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 11:53
Do that part because there are so many things that can be done.
You know, you might be able to say from the outside that there's the right way to do things, but there's this. I think I talked about Keegan in our last... The idea of psychology driving it and what he calls adaptive problems versus technical problems.
Robert Boulos | 12:12
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 12:13
People who are saying you should be doing X this way, you're treating what could be an adaptive problem as if it were a technical solution and those.
That's just a mismatch. Of course, you should do X. I think we do that with children, and one of the things I'm trying to do right now is give them better thinking patterns.
Robert Boulos | 12:23
Hmmmmmmm.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 12:30
So instead of saying, "Hey, when this happens, you do this."
It's like you ask these questions.
Robert Boulos | 12:36
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 12:36
So we were just at breakfast. I'm one-on-one with one of my sons today. The other one's going peach picking with his mother, and we watched Roy Sutherland's TED Talks.
Robert Boulos | 12:49
Nice.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 12:50
RO Roy Sutherland's. Now, you know, vice chair WP or one of those large advertising agencies.
He's just a wonderful thinker about counterintuitive marketing. I got him his book, "Alchemy," and they love the book. So, getting to watch those talks... It's like, "Okay, how do you think differently about things?" The whole opposite of a good idea is a good idea, and getting them to work differently. We played two games just today. The first one, I beat him, and he beat me by doing better. The thing that I was doing better in the first game...
So, how do you think about this? How do you have what we call board vision? Okay, what? Why do I bring all this stuff up? I bring all this stuff up because yes, there's a good fraction of this that's exploring what the maximum version of you is and which parts of this give you joy.
It's crappy that this thing happened. You make the call. There are going to be jerks about it. You don't have time to be working with jerks, deciding, "Okay, well, the penalty I pay is I can write a check for $250 and not have to think about this again." Done.
Robert Boulos | 14:04
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 14:04
My father would not have thought that way because, besides whatever he thought about conflict, he grew up poor. Very poor,
rural poor in Missouri. His father was a drunk and a bad dude. Yeah, he dedicated his life to his family, but always that guy who wanted to... He would go to work and then he would come home and work on his home, right? That was
the way he was at home, right? So his relationship with his children was... His sons wanted to get in on projects with him because that was the way to be spending time with Dad.
But... His whole approach to how you solve a problem was through the application of your time.
Robert Boulos | 14:53
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 14:54
And viewed that into his children as well. I remember talking to my uncle about this and how managing this... We have a lakeside cottage, which is actually...
I got married, which is about half an hour from here, and it's a beautiful lake, it's a sweet cottage, it has it maximized for the number of bedrooms. It was going to be a family place. It was something that we all shared.
It's great. I had taken care of it after my grandfather passed. We didn't live here. This was running back actually, the financial crisis times 2008 from the time. Then I took care of it for about a year, and then my uncle stepped up, and he wanted to be running it, and he basically just ripped it out of my hands. Fine. His generation, his call, that's all.
Okay, but when I was talking about systems, I put in place, he was ripping out the systems? Yeah, the systems because he didn't want to have a... Hey, when something goes wrong here, you make this call. He wanted... When something goes wrong here, you get out of the wrench.
Robert Boulos | 15:53
Yeah. Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 15:54
He wanted to be the one who was doing it, and he wanted anybody else who was coming in to be the one who was doing it. He wanted to be done the way his father did it.
And I realized that that's just the way it was going to be going for him, and it was never going to be the way I wanted it to go. There are lots of things I want to lay my hands on for that I find to be interesting.
Many of the things that he associates with being "that's where you spend time at home" is not the way I spend time. All as I've learned, like with my children, what am I doing? I'm teaching them.
That's my highest form. I'm teaching them academics or taking the job, what would otherwise have been institutional school, not. They come home from school, and the way they get to spend time with Dad is by working on whatever garage project or whatever.
Robert Boulos | 16:38
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 16:39
And bring that to really the idea of masculinity, right? What was their experience of being with a man and what does that look like? How can we look at that a little more expansively, right?
Possibly in a way that hopefully I'm setting them up to create wealth as well.
Robert Boulos | 17:01
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 17:02
Anyway, to dwell on all this stuff just by way of saying that I hear where you're coming from, and I've had the same set of "You should do X" conversations.
Robert Boulos | 17:12
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 17:13
And in my consulting career, I gave a whole lot of "You should do X", and I sometimes point you in a specific direction, but I try to be conscious of the difference between what's an adaptive question and what's the technical question where a technical question is like, "This is generally right or is right based on what I understand about you." Perhaps that is better than you understand about yourself.
Robert Boulos | 17:35
Yeahm.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 17:40
And is actionable in that way versus those things that you know might be right if you were someone else or even might be right for who you are. But isn't that a point where you're even ready to have that conversation?
That's like the adaptive stuff, and neat ideas that Keegan really highlights in his next book, which is called "Immunity Change", which I read, whatever, a month ago.
Robert Boulos | 17:54
Yeah?
rhdeck@gmail.com | 18:03
The. makes the point that when you have an adaptive problem, the solution is not the next step. It's not to solve it. It's to learn more about why it's a problem for you. He says,
"Hey, win the two categories. What do you do about this one?" Well, you can fix it. The technical solution solves the technical problem. But this one technical problem, you're not going to solve it.
Robert Boulos | 18:31
Yeah. Yeah?
rhdeck@gmail.com | 18:31
You want to understand it. You want to lean into it because that's going to be how the problem changes you and allows you to be making progress.
Maybe not doing the thing that you think you should have done because you... Why am I not doing this? So obviously, doing X. Except you shouldn't be doing X. You probably should be doing Y. You're just not ready to understand why. Forgive the punt. Why is your answer right? That needs to be for yourself.
Robert Boulos | 18:55
Yeah?
rhdeck@gmail.com | 19:00
I mean, just to put this in organizational terms with the company with which we are both familiar. I mean, Xano has. You know, it seems obvious that there are certain technical things that they should be doing either from a both from a point of view and a market point of view.
Robert Boulos | 19:11
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 19:15
And there are people at Zero who see that pretty clearly, too. Those things aren't happening. The reason they're not happening is because Zero's psychology is, of course, driven by his two principles.
The real issue needs to be understanding what they are going to do, right?
Robert Boulos | 19:31
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 19:32
And anything that involves adjusting the path. Adrift from what they would do needs to be treated as an adaptive problem, right?
Robert Boulos | 19:42
Very interesting. Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 19:44
You should be doing XI. I tried that actually with Sean Montgomery. I had a conversation with MCP. Weeks later, he introduced the first version of MCP. It was impressive. He got that crap know?
Robert Boulos | 19:56
Nice.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 19:57
Dad didn't look at it again, so it didn't start them on a journey. It was like an immediate reaction and then reversion to form.
Robert Boulos | 20:08
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 20:09
So when we look at that, it's worth knowing what your form is, right? Of course, for him, it's the good forms. This thing was a distraction from what he thinks is really important.
I'm pretty sure what he thinks is really important is creating a new... He's really about debops.
Robert Boulos | 20:28
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 20:28
Would you dig underneath it? The whole Xanoscript thing, whatever else, it's never the functions stack that I think others will look at and say, "Hey, that's the big thing about Xano."
It's not his big thing. His big things are much more about setting up a machine. He wants to compete with Terraform.
Robert Boulos | 20:45
Yeah, that's true.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 20:46
He wants to create the better version of Terraform. If you look at Terraform Xanoscript and HCL, you will find far more influences on how sales script works than you.
It's like another scripting language that you might otherwise associate with the word script.
Robert Boulos | 21:07
Actually, I'm looking at Terraform right now, and I could see actually, yeah, very interesting.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 21:11
Like. Yeah. That's familiar. Right.
Robert Boulos | 21:15
Like. And I see your point about how the principles of Xano and how they impact the psychology of the rest of the organization.
Because when I met John, I could feel that this was a person who fit the Xano brand in a lot of ways, in the sense that he was a nice guy first of all. Just... But very much more focused on himself and
what he does. He was looking at it as, "Do you know what I do? Why do you have for me?" type of thing, which is fine. I understand that, but I definitely noticed it. For me, I can speak in those terms with people, so I can tell.
Yeah, of course, we're here to talk about the enterprise. You work with enterprise clients, and this appeals to enterprises and to appeal to his interests and to...
So he was leaning in and everything, but I could see that this was a person. I could see the similarity. I can tell our common attitude a little bit from the people that I've met from Xano. I can say I can tell they all know each other, and they're all similar in some type of way. But.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 22:39
And is why I use the term organizational psychology because the psychology of the organization then gets imbued upon people, particularly in their professional contexts.
Robert Boulos | 22:48
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 22:49
So you see, you... So, the characteristics would be that they are steady eddies, right? Much more about steadiness than excitement.
Robert Boulos | 22:56
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 22:59
They are about, you know, incremental progress rather than, you know, wild invention or innovation.
Robert Boulos | 23:05
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 23:06
They are like, say, they are internal and external. They're staying in their lanes,
so you don't find people in sales who have a lot of technical shops, and you don't find people in technology who have much in the way of sales shops.
Robert Boulos | 23:18
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 23:19
This is... Then, when you look at those attributes, you can start to predict behavior, both good and bad.
Robert Boulos | 23:26
Yes. Yes, yeah, for sure.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 23:27
And I have to understand... But the agent, this whole agent thing, is really about the pre-cash side of being more... Designing one has something you can explain in cocktails, right? The actual product progress and the actual technical progress are not going in that direction.
It's going in the direction of... What? Where is Shank Montgomery's mind? Which is about basically becoming the DevOps king. Now, this doesn't need to be a conversation about Zoho, but I wanted you to get the idea that this idea of psychology and describing behaviors is something you can apply to yourself but can apply to other, bigger organizations. It allows you to anticipate their actions,
and you can see these things and how they might not all be going in exactly the right direction and still admire them.
Robert Boulos | 24:23
And it can.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 24:24
Saw saw that with me, too.
Robert Boulos | 24:26
Yeah, I mean, I appreciate it. I think there's a lot of lessons. There's always a... That's what I enjoy about it.
If I try to follow it as my... It's something that if I can just develop the skill of picking it up, look at it, understand it, and then... Okay, that's it. Now put it down and now just move on.
So, that's all it is, so I appreciate it. It's helpful, definitely. So, thank you. I just... Something that is the emotional side of it. I suppose we're... And the human side of it.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 25:11
Yeah.
Robert Boulos | 25:12
But, yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 25:12
The. Yeah. Well, let's keep going. There have been a number of things that happened this week. You've already given the report on what's happened, but which of these... There are multiple potential directions we can take this in a way that might be more helpful to you.
When you had the night in the morning, right? To think about what's been going on in the write-up you already did, what's popping into the top of your mind as being most important, particularly for thinking about what to do this week.
So we make sure we keep returning things to action.
Robert Boulos | 25:49
I think this week I really have to... I really want to get the billings up. I think, obviously, it's taken... I undertook something that, looking back on it in the last two months, I can see now where it's all heading towards a good place where I can reap the benefits of the actions that I've taken over the last few months. Setting up a lot of different things. When you put them all together,
you look at my strength, and I think I feel my ability to just be a pleasant person, to be on the phone with, to be able to talk about different types of technologies. The things that I've made. The technology behind the MCP tool.
My interest in the conversations and just overall, the conversations that I have with and continue to have with people, there is something an offer there that I look forward to offering, which is something that is in the vein of, I think, some type of paid monthly group consulting.
I think... And but one way or another, I think that that's probably my opportunity or the opportunity to go forward into... I just feel... I think I don't know why, but I'm kind of anxious about it in a weird way. I'm not sure why.
Maybe it's just a fear of failure or... I would almost say that it's a fear of... I mean, fear of almost like fear of being overwhelmed, but I am already... But I've been... But I handle it... It was like, "You're fear of pressure." I was like, "Well, I'm already in pressure."
So the only thing is... So I'm trying to ignore certain thoughts that I'm having because I think that there's this human tendency to try to say to try not to repeat mistakes.
If you failed and don't make two failures in a row, I think that they're because maybe, from when we were like cavemen or whatever in the Savannah, if you make two mistakes on the road,
you're dead. So I'm fighting through this instinct to try to... I'm trying to fight towards more... whatever headwind and pain in that direction to get to this other side where I have this really positive, great feeling of being able to give more of this thing that people have identified that they want more of.
I think that that's... I got the signal. I feel like I've been looking for a while, which is that I always wanted to raise a demand to the level where people basically are telling me straight up, "I want you to charge me for this."
It's happened right where somebody has told me that, and he pretty much has described the offer to me. He has told me what he wants. He says that he wants to train these junior developers. In his own words, he wants to train 18-year-olds and be able to build projects like giving them the tool and having them use the Xano or the Snappy Xano MCP tool.
But he's aware that some developers might not want to use AI and are not too open to the tool. I told him, "I would expect that you want a developer who will use AI exactly.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 30:00
Good developers aren't your market.
Robert Boulos | 30:03
And and I think when I told him that, he thought, "Okay." Then I thought, "You don't have to train them." I said, "You could always have them join the calls and give them the tool."
If they can learn how to use the tool through joining calls like this, I'm still like that. That's where the idea is shaping. It is shaping into... But I could probably... I think that's where I hesitate almost.
I think the part where I hesitate is just how to package the whole thing. I think to say, "What am I?" Is this a Xano tool? Is it whatever? MCP, is it whatever? And I think actually, I'll share my screen. I can show you what I like because, again, you mentioned it to me once that when I can see it and it's real, that's the way I am. This is what I landed on, something more or less. AI-accelerated development seems to be because there's a lot of people who don't get the results with AI, I think I've been seeing this trend in the news where people in companies invest a lot in AI and then they don't get the results and so on.
So, I think the idea is to just... Because every time I seem to hop on the phone, people are amazed. They don't seem to know what it is that I know. They are or what you know and what the people who are spending the most time on this stuff like and they love learning about it. This is interesting to me because it just... I think it encapsulates using the Xano tool itself, the Happy Xano tool.
It's about just being accelerated development, anyways. But these are all just words that can change. I like the pretty orange and purple color. That's where my mind is. I'm not sure if this is... I'm trying to pick up all the conversations we've had. We talked about this word, "AA," accelerated. We talk about accelerated development and all these different things. I'm trying to connect the dots, and based on what I spoke about with Luke, trying to say, "Okay, so is it this?"
I think it's this, but again, I'm trying to turn away from this, and then the question is just like, "Okay, so if that is the right direction, then what do I charge for it?" And so on and those other questions.
So, yeah, I feel very positive. I feel grateful that this opportunity is even possible. I feel just very grateful, but now I just want to turn it into something that truly grows because once... I feel like if I do it the right way, and if it is the right way,
then it seems like a good opportunity, but I wouldn't... I'm not jumping ahead straight to saying that this is the right way.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 33:34
All right, let's step back to just being a little simple.
Robert Boulos | 33:36
Yp, yep.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 33:39
I think you have basically three offers in front of you. You can tell me that this is right to you. One is Xano. You know MCB development.
Sorry. Development of Xano using your MCB technology, right?
Robert Boulos | 33:56
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 33:57
We find that snappy. MTB second is interaction with Universe using your MC server, which is not about development with the Universe, mind you.
That is, it's about access, right?
Robert Boulos | 34:10
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 34:10
Because the big virtue of it is that you're talking to Databa, which I find super exciting, right? So that's not a software development gag, it's a data access and data access analysis, manipulation gag, which I think is a pretty strong one. A reason why I think Airtable is actually really in good shape with this.
Robert Boulos | 34:29
Interesting.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 34:29
A both on the MC side. More naturally, when you think of the back of their backend relationships, they build data as opposed to with code, and then third MC for you, right? You help with building MSPs now. I tend to think that that.
Robert Boulos | 34:54
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 34:55
That door number three is one that you... I thought this was like the big thing for you, but you keep on not going down that road.
Right now, I think you seem to have more comfort with the Xano thing in particular, and then with the Universe thing a bit, which I think is fine.
Robert Boulos | 35:10
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 35:11
One of the things I had thought was going to happen with the meetup was much more about building for AI, but it turns out not that as we get more people. A conversation between you and me is more about building for AI conversation you have with other people. It tends to be about building with AI for whatever their existing use cases are.
Robert Boulos | 35:33
Gash just one caveat, this is because it is very interesting. What you just raised is because Luke actually mentioned yesterday he did expressly tell me he's like, "I want to build the MCP servers. How did you build your MCP server?" I noticed when I make... I have mine on Xano, it's not easy to share with people, it's very ugly.
I have to give them this whole code when you use yours. This one nice URL... He wants it. Then he told me it would be a good product for you to build. It would be something that just makes it easier to build MCPS.
So, people, there's all kinds of... So, but just to say that was... Not the first, but one of those, just... I mean, you took the words right out of that conversation.
I mean that. So, I totally see where you're coming from with that.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 36:23
Cool. So what I would like to do then? So, I think that the weekly event that you have becomes your way of connecting with the market,
right? I'd take it that one of your hours of on-camera time was you being on for... That was the other one. Like one of the state change meetings or.
Robert Boulos | 36:44
Yeah, it was exactly that. These are, well, actually, yeah. No, it was... You're right.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 36:52
Okay, well, if I can count as being on camera, you can do that. But then there's just being out in the market. I think you have put your finger on it correctly, which is that what you want to do is either talk about... There's a better way to build and Xano as is your content that you got out there, right? I built this thing. Not that I built this thing in Sapi, but look, this stuff gets built out so fast and it's auto-documented. Whatever.
How amazing it is to make this stuff. Xano won't promote it because Xano doesn't have much in the ecosystem for them to promote. I think one of the things I've realized is that Xano psychology from a product point of view is, is there always going to be hostility to third-party developers?
But from a marketing point of view, they are desperate for something to do in marketing because they don't have any resources or really capacity to do much in the way of marketing. This is where Daniel Peectro becomes useful.
Robert Boulos | 37:52
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 37:55
Like. can't really get... Yeah, I think part of the problem here is that Daniel doesn't really have approval to boost other people's efforts, which I think is silly. One of the things I want to do with YMI and Miha is get a roadmap together, saying, "Hey, with Andrew who you've met."
I don't think they help these people get business. I think they turned around and said, "This has got to be part of Zano's Xanoscript story, launching this story and saying, "Hey, look, as a result of Sanscript,
look at all this third-party stuff that's going on." I don't know if Zero actually just released an SDK for building in VZero programmatically, so you can actually make your own VZero wrapper, communicating with a chat bot or having an MCP that goes and talks to their chat, and just is able to execute on it.
Robert Boulos | 38:32
Yes. Really.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 38:55
The opportunity to turn things really aggressively with that is, I think, enormous. I look at that and I think that's cool, and frankly, I look at that and think that would be a really interesting play for you to be looking at as a two-MCP or REST, whatever that looks like.
Robert Boulos | 39:01
Yes.
Yes, actually, and just.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 39:15
I mean, there are lots of ways to be going about that, but... But the reason I was bringing it up.
Robert Boulos | 39:19
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 39:19
Okay? This idea of you with MC, especially since Xano seems to be dropping the ball on MC. I'm pretty sure they're going to come out with WellKnown sometime in the month of September because...
Yeah. Daniel was asking me a question because he was trying to run a test on their WellKnown implementation. So I think they're going to have it. Once they have WellKnown, you'll be able to introduce the OAT stuff, right? Able to... Whether it's saying... Good for it. Now no.
Robert Boulos | 39:50
Yeah, WellKnown. So they're going to introduce.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 39:56
And that's how your servers are getting or your clients are getting the memo on how to do OAT with your MC server, which you might not be totally aware of because you're sort of using CloudFire stuff. You're allowing them to take care of more of the concerns.
Robert Boulos | 40:07
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 40:15
But essentially, you know what you've got is a gRPC server and you have some gSON files at known endpoints. That's what the WellKnown directory is. It's not well known because it's well known to be that stuff is there and then a particular file to tell other clients how to work with your server. That's to discoverability in these services.
Robert Boulos | 40:27
Yes. Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 40:38
Sam's about to have a de minimis support for it. I don't know if it'll be available to ZANOSCRIPT or anything else, but there'll be something there, right?
Then you're looking around like how else can we build these things becomes a question. And then I... When I think about the arc of your business. I think you have a near-term because of the relationship you already have and the reputation you have on the Xano side. You can be all right. Here's Xano. Here's AI.
I've got the first ever Xano MCP server that uses Xano script. Go say they use Xano script. Put that up there, right?
Robert Boulos | 41:17
Yeah, just say it uses answer.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 41:20
Because the chickens you're talking to have a certain level of sophistication in order for them to care about what you're doing.
Robert Boulos | 41:27
Yes, it's using their language.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 41:30
First ever uses ZSCRIPT, blah. You know Xano doesn't like fucking.
Robert Boulos | 41:35
[Laughter] Yes, exactly.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 41:36
But more importantly, it's really good for them and be.
Robert Boulos | 41:40
They should like it, but.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 41:43
No, you can't do this. No, it would be so terrible if you just left that up there. We can't let you do that, except we're not going to do anything about
know that.
Robert Boulos | 41:51
[Laughter] yes, that.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 41:52
You. I really think this is good for them and good for you. And you're out there, and I think that's a strong pitch. I don't want it to be a framework. I want it to be built in Xano. Ten times faster.
That's the promise.
Robert Boulos | 42:13
And I would actually say that on the technology side of things, it's kind of crazy, but I mean, first of all, I don't know what I'm looking forward to our call tomorrow about their.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 42:26
Don't me, you.
Robert Boulos | 42:27
Yeah, and because I'm not sure what they've built. I hope it's not going to make my efforts totally redundant, but.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 42:36
No, yeah, I would not they have not made an MCP server. What they have done, they've just extracted... They have made a language interpreter for that, which works.
Robert Boulos | 42:48
Yes, so.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 42:50
And then they have a bridge into VS code, right? To be able to, you know, pull function stacks out or pull configs out, modify them and send them back.
Robert Boulos | 43:00
So what's really interesting to me is that once I broke through and I made this... I guess you could call it an SDK. Now, most of the time it actually works. I actually built the website itself. I'll share my screen. It was built using the tool. The actual brains of it... That's where I really found a breakthrough.
I'm actually using this thing, and it's very reliable. All of these were made without me having to do any real debugging. I did barely any debugging, and it created all of these. For now, I'm adding logging and everything.
It actually works because the reason why is I'm trying to address what Luke wanted from a technical point of view. He wants to share it with his team, and he wants his team to have access.
So I'm adding these configurations, all this stuff actually works. It has the brains of it on Xano. So it's totally... The MCP has never been performing better. I think the thing that I... What I ended up doing, which I'm not sure if I should even think of it, but I had to AI design an AI language for itself. That was because AI is only going to try to explain things in a certain amount of ways.
So it's only going to say... It's going to say either "author.authorization.doc.create.token" or "doc.create.auth". It's all trying to say the same thing, and you just never know what the way it's going to say it necessarily.
So I just tried to create. I tried to create this SDK that's on top of the Xano script SDK now. It's like this case switching that takes whatever the AI provides, tries to accommodate for all the possibilities, and just translates it into what the SDK actually recognizes and then teaches it about what the correct version would have been at the same time. It says, "We just switched this for you.
Just letting you know basically." So, what it does is it outputs it in a very specific, determinative format so that it's always more or less the same result. It's a calculator that starts in a whole bunch of different ways.
It's all different possibilities. It always ends up in one place. So, this is just to say that it's interesting. What that allowed me to do is to use it myself and maybe just come in more confidently with that idea of, "This will help you build Xano ten times faster."
I know it will because I use it genuinely to build faster on Xano. So, yeah, I feel more comfortable putting it up.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 45:59
So I might propose that you look at this as having three time scales to it and, frankly, three levels of opportunity. Xano is a small company, and I don't want it to grow like I'm on teams.
Robert Boulos | 46:10
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 46:15
Let's grow in
a way that... I think if it grows, then we're all going to make money, right?
Robert Boulos | 46:19
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 46:21
But the organization psychology thing I was talking about, they're going to grow the way they grow. Now, I do think that because of your focus on the Xanoscript side, you're actually much better positioned than somebody who wants to be talking about building MCPS with Xano because I think what's actually happening is Xano. Xano wants to be doing Xanoscript, Xano thinks that it should be doing agents, and MCP is neither of those two things.
Robert Boulos | 46:47
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 46:48
So I'm expecting a little bit of stuff to come out for MCP, but then, you complain about it. Well, I don't know what you want or hurt, but I think those are the competition for Zoho psychology. It's going to be those other two.
The one that's way in the lead is the one that Montgomery is running. So the fact that you're right there with Xanoscript, I think, allows the marketing people to stop fighting the whole "We should be doing agents instead" battle, right?
Robert Boulos | 47:05
Yp.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 47:14
Sure, the Asian technology, whatever, but the US is terrible for that. I have tried helping people build with that thing. But the SANDSCRIPT is interesting, especially because it comes through the endpoints.
Robert Boulos | 47:22
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 47:26
I think it's the worst way to solve that particular problem. As you know, I have no problem with the script itself, but the idea of looking at Xano as being programmable I think is a big unlock in value for them and more, and I don't think it's a big unlock at the... Some gomer looking to build yet another web app, right?
Robert Boulos | 47:29
Yes.
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 47:46
I think this is unlocked for enterprises because enterprises are where people want to build weird and fast. What does this let me do that nobody else lets me do?
Robert Boulos | 47:49
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 47:56
That's it. This is the story now. It decides what they really want people to do, which is to be using their own first-party MCP server for working with ZVASCRIPT.
Maybe that can be how it goes, but the... But right now, I seem to have incompetence in that regard, and you having... Hey, look, I've been building this stuff. This is the third version.
Robert Boulos | 48:18
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 48:18
You know, I got this thing dialed FN that.
Robert Boulos | 48:21
Yeah, it is.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 48:23
Okay, so that, I think, is a good first story for you because I think you can sell that. I think you can sell that to Xano.
Robert Boulos | 48:28
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 48:30
That's why I'm saying you were talking to John. Great. Yeah, I want to put you and me in front of Andrew and see if we can make that part happen.
I've always sent him a note. He and I are supposed to get together in September, so I'm hoping it'll be the first half. We'll see what's going on. But the biggest thing is you just need to go sell, right? You need to go, and this is where you already have a couple of client prospects, and you're like, "We can talk about the details of the offer or whatever," but I think you want to just be clear. This is what it can be. You can buy it now.
Robert Boulos | 49:08
Exactly. Yeah, and it all boils down to that. I do think that I have something viable, and to be honest, I have a bit of leverage because it's like, honestly, and this is the part where I'm trying to figure out... I don't know. There are people who are using the tool like yesterday, and they really want me to be available. They're paying for this, and they want stability. They want to know that it's going to continue. In the client's own words and Luke's own words, saying that he depends on this tool, and whenever he can't access it, usually, it's because of his own... Actually it's been a 100% turned out to be user error.
It's never been an issue with. With the. The server itself, but however he wants this, you know.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 49:57
So you offer them lot of customization and you charge for it, so.
Robert Boulos | 50:00
Yes, yeah, but I don't know, to charge. I think that's my problem. I think I just don't know what to charge for it because I'm. I'm kind of, like, always thinking about this, like high three hundred dollars an hour, and like, I'm always in that mindset.
And so this is like now I don't. And, yeah, so I'll just say that I don't know.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 50:23
Okay, well, what do you think? This guy... Lu... Will he be ready to buy.
Robert Boulos | 50:28
I think he'd be ready to buy. That's a real question, isn't it? I feel like my instinct is telling me that if a person has a team, then they should get it. They should probably have a team deal. He has like a... He's interested in putting his team of developers, which is two to five people.
I've had discussions with others. So I look at him, I look at West. He wanted to meet with me and his developer, right? They end up joining the call together. I actually gave him my prices and they were too high for him throughout, which I think is actually progress. When he told me that, I was like, "Great. This is feedback." Not feedback in the sense of...
I think that there are other people who would pay that price, but it tells me about where somebody is on the market. Maybe if I explained it to him differently, he would go for it.
Just saying that, I think there is an offer there that West would relate to because he wants his team to benefit from learning. Just in general, the way that, in his words, the way that I do things.
So, anyway, so Megawatt stores short. I think maybe in for access to the tool and once a week meeting. Again, maybe I'm underpricing it, but $200-$300 a at.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 51:53
Yeah, that's true. So, I'm thinking $200 a month for you, for your initial customers you're going to have, weekly meetings, right?
I mean, I propose you have a mastermind style session, an office hours style session that's particularly like, "Hey, how to get more value out of this?
Robert Boulos | 52:11
Yep.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 52:14
And you make that a weekly meeting as well.
Robert Boulos | 52:17
Yeah, yes, yeah, exactly.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 52:18
Those second ones are recorded.
That's your content meeting, of course, you'll record, but you'll share that with them, and it's going to be more confidential.
Robert Boulos | 52:29
And I think that's maybe it's that simple.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 52:30
That's right. We do those not early. Now what you have is you're making $400 a month from those two clients, right?
And you have now committed yourself to three meetings a week, not for nothing. Three meetings a week. All that, Snappy MCP.
Robert Boulos | 52:47
Yeah, and it's something that I think, well, first of all, I think that, well, this is the way I was thinking it was that it would be $200 a month for each person.
So if it's... There'll be a team license because if he wants to drop in his devs, I think that that's where it becomes okay. Maybe Luke would pay eventually. He would end up paying... I don't know what the team license would be, then 800 a month.
And then he can just feel... This is what I'm trying to get to. Which is like Luke himself. I think there's an aspect of trust. We like that's what he's almost paying for. Which is to get to what you mentioned about what West's comments were about trust, and think about trust all the way down, like trust even into where trust is in terms of what Luke wants. Luke is not a person who is the best at explaining these concepts, but he wants his team to benefit from these concepts. He wants to trust that his team has access to the tools continuously, but that they're knowing how to use the tools continuously from the people he trusts.
And I think... So just to say that, I think that what he's getting in exchange for paying that is to say that it's like daycare in a way. "Okay, go talk to Robert. Go join the meetings that he puts together, and he'll set you straight."
Then that way, I know you're working on my projects properly and you're using the techniques that I want. You use use?
rhdeck@gmail.com | 54:05
I actually put together a shared calendar. In fact, I made it, and I can show you how to do it, but you can just make yourself a shared calendar because that way they can just put it on their dev calendars, and then they just... Okay, what are these? These are the Snappy Elite.
Sorry. So these are the Snappy Elite. You know the Snappy Elite office hours, which are weekly, right? That's really what they're paying for. That's what they're getting out of it. That's what they're paying for.
Robert Boulos | 54:37
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 54:42
200. Then you're saying, "Hey, look, as part of this being early, we're going to set up a call every week. We're doing that."
Then, depending on who you have coming in, if we find that you're drowning the thing, then we're going to have a conversation about keeping it to just your share of the stuff.
Robert Boulos | 55:02
Yeah. Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 55:03
And we can look at having special sessions, right? So you're going to look, this is going to give you access to me, right? I'm looking to keep it up. No, and I'm around, so we're going to do that.
Well, you're going to have an SLA. We're not going to formalize an SLA, that's just not going to be the way it works, right? The thing is, all too has too much stuff going on and we're working together and it's a too small bit of money, right? You want to have an SLA? We need to write a bigger check, but we want to have... Hey, let's get some sport going here.
Robert Boulos | 55:36
Yes. Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 55:37
And we're keeping it small, and then, well, I thought it would be more than that. Well, this is all we're talking about here, right? Let's do this for a week, let's do a call, let's do office hours, right? You have to do two calls, and then based on what we see over the course of September, we can adjust. My star is that I want you to get a ten to one return on investment.
Robert Boulos | 56:05
Yeah, yes, yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 56:06
So if this isn't ten to one, then we're not doing it right. If you're giving you more, if you're taking on more and then paying for more is the pathway to you getting ten to one on a bigger one, then that's a bigger ten for you as well.
So let's make that so. What you want to do is put yourself in a position where they want to spend more money on you, and I think you can. I think you can do that. So, I think that a key thing for you in terms of the Stappy stuff this week is one, you want to close a couple of customers, and you want to define a preliminary offer.
Okay. This is like the best state change. When I started, 30 bucks a month, there were three people who state changed before I changed it. Before I raised the price, and then raised the price raised the price.
Robert Boulos | 56:53
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 57:00
I price pretty much every week for the first three months of state change, and then I sat for one and it took about eight to ten months before I raised rates again, and then I haven't really raised rates since, at the top rate since 2023 and I could.
Robert Boulos | 57:06
Nice.
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 57:18
But the reason I'm saying all that is that early on, you can change it a lot, and they'll be like, "Can I leave and come back?" The answer is, "Sure," but the rate's going to be whatever it is that so people.
Robert Boulos | 57:31
True.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 57:32
Yeah, sure, go. You should only use what's going to be helpful to you. Well, can I come back and get the same rate I did? No, and that's just it. It doesn't need to be that.
Robert Boulos | 57:39
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 57:43
And, I think if you have a price, you don't have to live with it because you don't... Because not everyone's going to accept it. You're going to have a couple of people, and then there'll be crickets. Fine. That gives you something to work with. Now, you have a relationship with customers who will show up, who will start to fill up your content, right?
Start to fill up your... Improve your knowledge and give you energy. That's going to be moving you forward, right?
Robert Boulos | 58:07
Yes, for sure.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 58:08
And, could you do X? Like, "Okay, well, do consulting too." That's what we're talking about here. I kind of hope you could do it as part of making this like.
Robert Boulos | 58:14
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 58:17
No, that's how it bounds, but I'm glad to do it on a consulting basis.
Then you can add that, right? Okay, but so that's phase one. I actually wanted to walk through all three phases just so you separate them.
Robert Boulos | 58:29
Suremm yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 58:29
The second one, the first one is for Forzo, I think you want to have an offer, you want to go. You don't need a website for it. What you need is Stripe, right? I want to go to them with a Stripe billing link
so they can get the subscription and then make sure it collects. I actually have a problem right now where I let people sign up for some team accounts and say change was never collected in the course for the last ten months.
So it's like a thousand dollars. Actually clicked in and stuff.
Robert Boulos | 58:58
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 58:59
It wasn't ever that huge, but the... But, yeah, I'm expecting, in that same spirit, of the lost 250, I'm expecting that money is just gone, having had those kind of collection problems in the past.
So I've got that. I've got the... Okay, so part one is to go make the sales for the individuals. You're keeping the public thing, right? Which is great, because the public thing can be multiple things, right?
Then you're having the two privates and then you are... You've got a couple of clients, you got a thing and then your website for a snappy Xano MCPs Xano specific script, not No, that's too hard, right?
Robert Boulos | 59:33
Yes. Yeah, it's Xano specific. Not framework. Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 59:43
Ten times faster would Xano use you know,
build in Xano from Claude Desktop. Claude code, you know, wherever there is M CP automatic automatically like it's the.
Robert Boulos | 59:53
Yes I yeah bit yeah sure.

Now you can see what's above the fold now, right? I have a screenshot on the right. I'd probably turn it into a little bit of a gallery, right? You've got a screenshot of what it looks like
on the desktop, which is actually a little bit unclear. I don't know exactly what's going on in that, and another one of seeing your emojis, right? Stuff that got built.
That's giving the feel. Then, what are they doing? They can sign up.
Robert Boulos | 01:00:35
Yes. For the... I guess that's the offers: $200 a month and then... This is maybe the part that... Maybe this is my one of... I'm not sure if it's a Doorkno question, but it's something that... Where does that leave the people who use it for free, let's say, like Daniel Petro? Do people get to use this stuff for free?
I'm totally... I mean, me, I will do everything for free, but so I'm trying to figure out where... But then there's... Because it's part of how people get value for me, there's that it does work for me in the market raising reputation.
So, just out of curiosity.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:01:17
Yes you can leave it going for free. The thing they're going to get is membership support, weekly office hours, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:01:26
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:01:28
The tools to help you make this go faster. It's just a piece of software. I don't know, this little black box here, that's the whole trust thing that Wes was talking about.
I'll do you one better. You know what? We haven't done this yet, and I wouldn't have this be a holdup, but I think it is entirely possible for you to create it. It's read-only and the free... The read-write is what you get with the pro.
Robert Boulos | 01:01:51
Three only. Yeah, I like that.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:01:58
Now I wouldn't be trying to make that happen yet.
I think you go get the customers, make the offer buyable, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:02:05
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:02:06
And in your next meetup, you're going to talk about, "Hey, good news, we've got an offer.
Robert Boulos | 01:02:12
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:02:13
And I would follow up with that, "I want your... As we start to dial in on this, now you have like your whatever 40 people who are using SNAPPMCP. I want to offer them the membership, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:02:30
Yeah, that's really good, actually.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:02:31
Reach out to them.
And if they if they're like, I don't want this, I don't just keep on using it for free, that's fine. You can always kick him off. I'm not saying you should saying like, there's no service guarantees, right?
Right. So you're basically we're giving them with not as much service guarantee. But you are giving them throat to joke when you talk about the this thing.
Robert Boulos | 01:02:53
Yeah, that's actually of... When I think of it that way, I feel like it's almost... It's a good... It's a solid offer. I mean, I don't see in my mind that, obviously, nothing in this world is a hundred percent, but it makes me feel very confident that there's a screw to turn there, where it's going to be...
But they'll be happy, they'll like. Okay, fine, I'll pay it, and I'm going to get more, and I'm going to get these things out of it.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:03:22
Okay, so this is number one. This is what I think you can probably most profitably do to make yourself money this week because the things we're talking about here are about giving you this initial offer, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:03:27
Yes, exactly.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:03:32
But they will immediately lead you to having more contact with people who want to buy your consulting, which will all be the same-oriented consulting.
Robert Boulos | 01:03:38
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:03:41
But think that's phase one. This is the lowest phase in some ways.
It's the Lex phase, but it's the lowest phase because it's you being to this small company and this tiny ecosystem.
Robert Boulos | 01:03:52
Yes, I got access.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:03:53
Phase two is where you need to be getting onto the forum and being getting into meetings with the people at Universe.
Robert Boulos | 01:04:05
I emailed her twice this week, so I've been chasing her down, and I got access just last night, so that's actually one of my goals for today. I'm going to join and just make the post, so yeah, for sure join a bed.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:04:22
About making posts yet join and read.
Robert Boulos | 01:04:25
Okay.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:04:29
I can't tell you how many people join and you can see the same day they joined they made a bunch of posts selling chat.
Robert Boulos | 01:04:36
Just true good advice actually. Thank you for the time. Yeah, I was going to be that guy.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:04:43
Most of the time when I join Slack or Discord, I look for conversations.
Robert Boulos | 01:04:47
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:04:50
Is there a place where you can be offering a useful bit of insight or just asking intelligent questions or just saying thank you so much for that information?
Robert Boulos | 01:04:59
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:04:59
Do that have a track record to those?
The most important reason you do that is because you should be reading, right? Gain flavor for what's going on, who the people are, and how to do it. Then you can, at the end of the week, be asking, "Is there something for you to be offering, like MCP and the forum?" When I'm talking about MCP, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:05:27
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:05:27
And if it is, then you open not with an announcement, you open with a question, right? Is anybody here, you know, working with MCP and Universe? And the answer is, no, but that seems kind of cool. Like, okay, that's great. I am working on that. I'm putting together a interest group and a meet up and would others be interested?
Robert Boulos | 01:05:51
Y.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:05:57
Like, don't know about that. I don't do many of these meetups, I just do forum topics. Okay, well, let's talk about the forum topic or there, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:06:03
Yeah. Very interesting.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:06:05
So. that way, instead of you imposing, right, you're learning and then...
It doesn't take very long, right? That's why I say it's to the end of the week.
Robert Boulos | 01:06:13
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:06:13
But if you start teaching, then you're in a position to be learning. This is what Arvid calls "embedding as an entrepreneur." You embed into your markets to learn more about where their pain points are because you have a particular piece of technology. How it solves problems for them is not necessarily all that clear, right?
So let's get wired into their problems and discover how close you are to the right thing. But either way, you're talking about MCPFS, and that could be interesting, but a more important thing is that if you're not just like we say that guy.
Robert Boulos | 01:06:47
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:06:47
Okay, so that that's the universe part that takes you up a level, and then the fact you're having those conversations you won't be feeding back into conversations you're having, like directly with the company or with your dad or whoever.
Right about how can we help these people make more money? Stage three, that's you and providing MCB consulting. I think you're going to find that in the course of doing phase one and phase two, you're going to find people who have demand for the MCB consulting just by talking about these things. We were asking, "Can I do that?" The answer is yes, sure, let's set up a call.
Robert Boulos | 01:07:23
Yeah yes, so true I.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:07:24
Here's my count and you DM them you countly on LinkedIn or whatever.
And then because it doesn't need to be going through the website, that means in this is the only when we talk about stamped at AI, the only offer you need to have is the Xano MCP.
Robert Boulos | 01:07:36
Yeah yes it's exactly yeah just the 200 the well the 200 exactly and which is the just to again like just so I'm clear in my mind which is 200 a month and so on and so that becomes the offer.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:07:55
So saying, "Hey, what's the big promise?" Develop ten times faster in Xano, people are like, "Hey, Xano, develop ten times faster." Make your time to magic minutes, you know, like the.
Robert Boulos | 01:08:18
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:08:18
And the way, I'm thinking about some of these things because I know that they're showing up in Zano's own board meetings. So, a little bit of what you're saying into Xano about how much they should want to be and be promoting you because you're using the kind of language they're going to care about.
Robert Boulos | 01:08:30
Yeah, maybe it's maic.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:08:38
Like Xano, and they keep on using them as examples of good things, even to the point where some of the template auto things, where there's a little bit of a bitch session going on over in the Xano community about how and whatever. You get around that. You provide speed with security, with control, with intent, like.
Robert Boulos | 01:08:50
Yeah? About what? About it? Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:09:01
This is just... It's just really good.
So, that's what I want for you, which is to be on top of that, and then because you're totally on top of... Hey, you're like the premier way of exploiting this. I want... This is why I want to get you.
Why I want Andrew involved because Andrew becomes the gateway to gain visibility from the product.
Robert Boulos | 01:09:19
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:09:20
What's this stuff going to look like? What is the shape of that going to be so you can be ready for it? We'll be deploying that in ten weeks. No, you want to announce it the day it comes out. You want to announce it and talk about how it is usable with... Not just inside them with these five other ways. Don't be an idiot.
Robert Boulos | 01:09:37
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:09:37
So we talked to the man, but the marketing person's going to be a little more receptive to that because he's trying to make a marketing happen, right? He doesn't have the same psychological barriers
that the product has. But we'll be able to put that to work for us anyway. That's why you can have the sale and this simplifies sales, right? I'm offering these three things. What should be on my website? The only thing you're selling right now...
So, what do you have in the banner on the top? "Hey, I've got a weekly MCP meetup which is totally on brand for you all the time, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:10:13
Yes, hu.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:10:14
Snap CP meetup every week, you've got... You're advertising those things out on LinkedIn.
If there becomes a way for them to get more trust in you, there's an easy way for them to buy from you immediately. You have the free offer in terms of them being a bug, a snappy MCP, you the free offer then leads to you offering the upsell, right? Offering the meet-up and then offering the upsell, and then the upsell itself gives you the wonderful opportunity, not just to be doing the weekly meetings.
Robert Boulos | 01:10:37
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:10:43
That's like. That's a one on one thing, right? That's what you offer to Luke. That's what you offer to Wes you don't offering that to others, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:10:50
Yeah, interesting.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:10:50
The deal for the 200 month is weekly meetings all the recordings you know a line for support and we're all making this and knowledge you're making this happen. Cool.
Robert Boulos | 01:11:05
Yeah, YY.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:11:06
You have...
Then, when they sign up for that app, you do an onboarding meeting. The onboarding meeting is your gateway to consulting final, if you don't mind. When Wes said that $300 was too steep, did you have an idea of what wasn't?
Robert Boulos | 01:11:24
No, he just... I mean, he didn't really... No, the answer is no.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:11:35
To find that a lot of these people, a lot of the agency types, are short on cash.
Robert Boulos | 01:11:41
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:11:42
I'm watching people leave state change because their agencies are failing.
And I appreciate you. You're probably, you know, a little sympathetic to that because, you know, you sort of. You're going through a bit of a, you know, been going through a bit of a phase of the course of the last sixty days, right?
Robert Boulos | 01:11:56
For sure.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:11:57
But the people like Wes... I as good as Wes is... I suspect the economics are not fantastic right now. So often you have the small companies, medium-sized companies, and large companies. Small companies do it DY because they can't afford anyo to help medium, you know, and medium is like small by bothers are the ones who are hiring those agencies, right?
And then you have the large companies and so large companies you really want to do business with. That's why I love the universe angle, because that's, you know, moving up the.
Robert Boulos | 01:12:34
Yeah.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:12:36
And it's why Xano is going to love you, because the story that you have is far.
I think is far more interesting for Enterprise.
Robert Boulos | 01:12:45
And an in-like to the same place. Sorry, just to say it, because it's always in my mind where I'm thinking about it. There's almost something repeatable there. You show up, it's like, "Here's the universe MC/P." Then
it all ends up back into the same conversation where it's like, "Okay, well, here's the other MC/P tools that this connects to as well." And here's how I'm using Playwright, and here's how I'm using it in Visual
today they came from their little world or they're using the universe and everything. Then they kind of come back into the same conversation where everyone can talk about the same stuff.
But anyways, it's just like... But The.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:13:18
Well, I can definitely see that. I suspect you're going to have a meetup that will be specifically for universe people because I don't think they're going to be the same types of people who are carrying COS stuff, but they both can be funnels to phase three.
Robert Boulos | 01:13:28
True yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:13:34
And why I see that that's what I'd like to do, build up phase one while laying some groundwork for phase two. I would like our conversation in, say, the second week of September, right? Basically in a week to be about... All right, we've got the Xano stuff going, let's start building out the universe stuff.
Robert Boulos | 01:13:50
Yeah, totally, thank you, Ray.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:13:52
Now we're talking about...
Okay. What's going to be the bigger market we think, which is not you building with AI in the previous two, but building for AI.
Robert Boulos | 01:14:07
I that was really just what made me feel a lot better just overall. So I just. I'm going to join the meeting, I'm going to join the forum read don't post immediately. I'm going to put together the offer, close the sales this week, real sales.
It's moving. It's like a Gariganta. I. Yeah, I'll just say that again. Like, I know I've said this before, but, like, I do. Sometimes I feel like one day in the future. I'm going to look back and like. How the heck did I have so much like that?
I think I will marvel at my own ability to push through as much as I'm. I'm kind of maybe blowing smoke up myself a little bit, but I could kind of. I'm. I'm feeling very positive and just and very grateful, and I think that this has all been.
It's all been worth it. So. Like. I just want to keep pushing.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:15:02
Yeah, I think you've got some wonderful assets. We just need to put them to work for you, and that basically becomes our objective over the course of the next couple of weeks.
Keep in mind that not all these objectives are the same. I mean, some of them are more important.
Robert Boulos | 01:15:21
4.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:15:22
Sure, fine. Now they're going to be equally easy, right? I might have some... I might have... I could spit it out easily from my lips.
That is easier for me to say than you to do.
Robert Boulos | 01:15:28
He.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:15:31
Maybe easier for me to do than you to do, right? That's where the whole psychology part comes in. So, just be aware of which parts of those are because there are enough things to do that rather than you getting stuck on any one of them, you're better off, you know, burning a little bit.
That would be something that I think we... Then, to the extent that you are feeling stuck in the course of the week, let me know because I think you got with September, the guns are going off.
Robert Boulos | 01:15:57
Yes.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:15:57
Let's.
Yeah, I think you've got some wonderful opportunities. I just want to make sure that you are in fact getting into the race. We're not doing our spin-up in September, but rather we have or put it a different way, to the extent that we're feeling like we need to do some spin-up, we do it earlier together, and you don't feel like, well, I guess I'll wait for Saturday or whatever. I'm very excited for you, and I'm here to help.
Robert Boulos | 01:16:24
Thank you very much, Ray, just in every way, I just hugely appreciate it and I'm going to put it to action. Thank you very much, see you.
rhdeck@gmail.com | 01:16:32
Fantastic. By. Bye.
